                Heavy monsoon rain and water from upstream in India's northeast have inundated large parts of the Sylhet division in Bangladesh. Millions of people are marooned without electricity which already triggered a humanitarian crisis.

                    The FFWC forecasted that the flood situation in Sylhet and Sunamganj districts is likely to deteriorate further in the next few days with heavy rain forecast. Experts consider the current flood worse than the ones they had experienced in 1998 and 2004.
